Device service for BACnet protocol written in C. This service
may be built to support BACnet devices connected via
ethernet (/IP) or serial (/MSTP).

## Build Instructions

### Requirements
This device service requires the [EdgeX Device SDK for C](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-sdk-c)

### BACnet stack
The device service is built using Steve Karg's BACnet stack version 0.8.6. Some
patches have been applied to enable the stack to be built using the musl C
standard library, to allow for building the device service in Alpine Linux. The
patched version of the stack is retrieved during the build process.

### Building the BACnet Device Service
Before building the BACnet device service, please ensure
that you have the EdgeX C-SDK installed and make sure that
the current directory is the BACnet device service directory
(device-bacnet-c). To build the BACnet device service, enter
the command below into the command line to run the build
script.

	make build

This will build two device services: device-bacnet-ip and
device-bacnet-mstp. To only build one of them, run the
build script with the parameter "ip" or "mstp" depending
on which device service you want to build. The command below
shows an example of this.

	./script/build.sh mstp

In the event that your C-SDK is not installed in the system
default paths, you may specify its location using the environment
variable CSDK_DIR

After having built the device service, the executable can be
found in `./build/release/device-bacnet-{ip, mstp}/device-bacnet-c`

## Running the Service

With no options specified the service runs with a name of "device-bacnet", the
default configuration profile, no registry and a configuration directory of res/ip (for Ethernet) or res/mstp (for Serial).
These settings may be changed on the command line as follows:

```
   -i,  --instance <name>      : Append the given instance to the service name
   -r,  --registry             : Use the registry service
   -p,  --profile <name>       : Set the profile name
   -cd, --configDir <dir>      : Set the configuration directory
```

## BBMD Setup
To run the BACnet/IP device service using a BBMD device, set
BBMD\_ADDRESS and BBMD\_PORT to the values corresponding to 
the BBMD device under the [Driver] section of the TOML
configuration.

## Supported BACnet Services
The device service uses the Who-Is BACnet service when doing
a discovery call, the Read-Property service when doing a GET
request, and the Write-Property service when doing a PUT
request.

## Limitations
The service can access Boolean, String, Int (Signed and Unsigned) and Float (Real and Double) types. Other BACnet types such as Enum, OctetString, Date and Time are not supported.

## Example Device Profiles
Example profiles for BACnet devices are included in the sample-profiles directory. The
profiles included are for the KMC BAC-4021C, KMC BAC-5051E, KMC BAC-5901CE, KMC
BAC-9001 and for the Simple Server Application from the BACnet stack.

## Example Configurations
An example TOML configuration for the device service is present in the res/
drectory. The configuration contains a commented out section with an
example on how to set up the device service to point to a BBMD device.

The default port for the service is 59980. The alternative port 59981 has been
reserved, for deployments where it is required to run instances of both ip and
mstp services.

## Documentation
Further documentation can be found in the docs/ directory. This describes
device addressing, deviceResource specification, operation with the simulator,
device service configuration, and containerisation of the device service.
