Containerisation of the BACnet device service.

The BACnet device service can be build in a docker container. A Docker file is
provided in the scripts/ directory using Alpine Linux 3.11 as the base image. To build an
image using this Docker file, change directory to the base directory of the
device service and execute the following command:

$ docker build --no-cache --tag bacnet-device-service --file ./scripts/Dockerfile.alpine-3.11 .

This will build the device service image containing both the BACnet/IP and
BACnet/MSTP device services.

Having built the docker image, a docker container can now be run. To run the
BACnet/IP device service execute the following command:

$ docker run --name bacnet-device-service --network=edgex_foundry_edgex-network -p 49980:49980 bacnet-device-service ip

The docker run command specifies the port to expose from the container. This
should be the same as in the TOML configuration file. The standard for the 
BACnet/IP device service is 49980, and the standard for the BACnet/MSTP device
service is 49981. The image also takes a parameter to select whether the
BACnet/IP or BACnet/MSTP device service should be run.

When running the BACnet/IP device service in a container, it will need to
communicate to a BBMD device to be able to contact devices that are not located on
the edgex_foundry_edgex-network. The BBMD device can be specified in the TOML
configuration in the res/ip/ directory.

Running the BACnet/MSTP device service in a docker container requires the MSTP
device path to be made available to the container. To do this, the --device
parameter needs to be set for the docker run command. An example of this can be
seen in the following command:

docker run --name bacnet-device-service --network=edgex_foundry_edgex-network -p 49981:49981 --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 bacnet-device-service mstp

The device specified in the "--device" argument should be the same as set up in
the [Driver] section of the TOML configuration located in the res/mstp
directory.

If no parameter is given to the image in the docker run command, the device
service will start both BACnet/IP and BACnet/MSTP up. If this is the desired
choice, remember to expose the appropriate ports for both services and the
device for the BACnet/MSTP device service. This can be seen in the following
command:

docker run --name bacnet-device-service --network=edgex_foundry_edgex-network -p 49980:49980 -p 49981:49981 --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 bacnet-device-service
